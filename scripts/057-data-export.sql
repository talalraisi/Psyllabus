-- Right of access: hand a person everything held about them.
--
-- Deletion has worked since 026 and access never has, which is the wrong way
-- round — a student could destroy their record but not read it. Both the PDPL
-- and the GDPR give a right to a copy, and a school asking how a subject
-- access request is answered needs a better answer than "email Talal".
--
-- SECURITY DEFINER because it reads fifteen tables and RLS on each would mean
-- fifteen policies doing the same check. auth.uid() is the only key: it reads
-- for the caller and cannot be pointed at anybody else.
--
-- Everything is returned in one JSON document rather than a file, so the
-- browser can offer it as a download without a storage bucket, a signed URL or
-- anything that outlives the request.
